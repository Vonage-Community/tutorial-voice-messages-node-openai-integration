## Integrate Phone Calls and SMS with OpenAI

We've already developed a starter Vonage Voice application to receive a call, catch your response, and send it to a 3rd party (OpenAI).
Users can deploy the App using Github Codespaces.
Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Vonage-Community/tutorial-voice-messages-node-openai-integration). Open it in Codespaces by clicking "Create codespace on main"
